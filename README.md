# MudaePinExchange
This is a simple HTML page that you can use to work out pin trades between two users "quickly"*.
1. Run the commands indicated by the placeholders
1. Copy the list of pins from the DM that the maid sends you into the inputs
1. Click process
1. Copy the output into Discord, putting $pe on the beginning. You can also paste the other user's list that they have to enter as well.

#### Notes
- \*"Quickly" - All commands used by this page have a 60-second cooldown per user, so you're looking at a minimum of 3 minutes to be able to run all of the commands.
- The script sets up a 1:1 trade by comparing both users' duplicate pins to the total list of pins, determining what pins each user has that the other does not, and then limiting the trade to the lower amount of pins.
